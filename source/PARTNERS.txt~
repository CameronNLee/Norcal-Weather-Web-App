Extra credit: We check for instance of san jose (ignoring case). So:

San Jose
san jose
san jose, ca
san jose, CA, US
.
.
.
etc

We solve the issue with the API by making a request for zip code 94088 instead of san jose

P.S If we missed any weather code svgs mappings sorry!!

ALSO, thanks to anon user for the SVG files for up an down arrow. Unfortunately, we had to include them as an SVG in the sources folder because we were scared to include a
whole assets folder within our submission (incase it interferes with grading). Sorry about that
